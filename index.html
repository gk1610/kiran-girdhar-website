    <p>
      I’m interested in how genetic risk for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease is encoded in the human genome
      and how this risk manifests as specific molecular programs in the brain. Rather than thinking about disease in
      terms of individual genes, my work asks how groups of regulatory programs emerge in particular cell types and how
      these programs change across the human lifespan.
    </p>

    <p>
      What especially motivates my work is the question of timing. Many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia,
      are highly heritable, yet clinical symptoms such as psychosis typically do not appear until adolescence or early
      adulthood, when the brain is still maturing. This raises a fundamental question: if genetic risk is present from
      birth, what drives the delayed onset of disease? Which cell types become vulnerable, and which molecular
      mechanisms shift during development to unmask this risk?
    </p>

    <p>
      I pursue similar questions in neurodegenerative disease, where genetic and regulatory vulnerabilities may remain
      latent for decades before becoming biologically consequential with aging. By studying cell-type–specific
      regulatory architecture across development, adulthood, and aging, my goal is to understand which parts of the
      genome become vulnerable over time and how these changes contribute to disease onset and progression.

    <h2>Research Focus</h2>

    <p>
      My research is centered on understanding how genetic variation shapes brain function across the human
      lifespan, and how this variation gives rise to vulnerability in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.
      I take a mechanistic, genome-wide view of disease risk, focusing on how molecular programs emerge in specific
      brain cell types during development, mature through adulthood, and become destabilized with aging.
    </p>

    <h3>Mechanistic insights into neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease</h3>
    <p>
     This is a highly data-driven research effort, grounded in the integration of large-scale human postmortem brain datasets 
     from multiple brain regions. As new data are produced, we systematically examine regulatory and epigenomic programs 
     across diverse cell types to identify those that are selectively vulnerable in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease.
     A complementary goal of this work is to connect shared and region-specific molecular programs across distinct brain regions, 
     providing an integrated, systems-level view of disease biology.This work is led by Hui Yang, Lyra Sheu, Swadha Singh and Chinwe Nwaneshiudu
     from our team. 
    </p>

    <h3>Healthy genome across the lifespan</h3>
    <p>
      In parallel, our team study the regulatory architecture of the healthy human genome across development, adulthood,
      and aging. By mapping chromatin accessibility and gene regulation in specific brain cell types, this project seeks to 
      define how molecular programs normally emerge, stabilize, and decline over time. This provides a critical reference for 
      distinguishing disease-related changes from normal developmental and aging processes.This work is led by Hui Yang from our team.
    </p>

    <h3>Role of repeat elements in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases</h3>
    <p>
      Tandem repeats (TRs)—short DNA motifs repeated consecutively—are highly polymorphic elements that comprise
      approximately 6% of the human genome, far exceeding the ~2% devoted to protein-coding sequences. Variation
      in TR length is known to influence gene expression, RNA splicing, and chromatin structure, positioning these
      elements as powerful regulators of genome function.Despite their abundance and functional impact, tandem repeats 
      and other repetitive elements have been largely overlooked in large-scale genetic studies, which have focused 
      predominantly on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As a result, the contribution of these highly mutable genomic 
      elements to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease risk—and to missing heritability more broadly—remains poorly 
      understood. This work, led by Christian Dillard as part of our team, aims to address this gap by integrating 
     repeat variation with cell-type–specific regulatory and epigenomic maps of the human brain.
