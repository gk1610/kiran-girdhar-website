                <h2>About</h2>
             
    <p>
      I’m interested in how genetic risk for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease is encoded in the human genome
      and how this risk manifests as specific molecular programs in the brain. Rather than thinking about disease in
      terms of individual genes, my work asks how groups of regulatory programs emerge in particular cell types and how
      these programs change across the human lifespan.
    </p>

    <p>
      What especially motivates my work is the question of timing. Many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia,
      are highly heritable, yet clinical symptoms such as psychosis typically do not appear until adolescence or early
      adulthood, when the brain is still maturing. This raises a fundamental question: if genetic risk is present from
      birth, what drives the delayed onset of disease? Which cell types become vulnerable, and which molecular
      mechanisms shift during development to unmask this risk?
    </p>

    <p>
      I pursue similar questions in neurodegenerative disease, where genetic and regulatory vulnerabilities may remain
      latent for decades before becoming biologically consequential with aging. By studying cell-type–specific
      regulatory architecture across development, adulthood, and aging, my goal is to understand which parts of the
      genome become vulnerable over time and how these changes contribute to disease onset and progression.

    <h2>Research Focus</h2>

    <p>
      My research is centered on understanding how genetic variation shapes brain function across the human
      lifespan, and how this variation gives rise to vulnerability in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.
      I take a mechanistic, genome-wide view of disease risk, focusing on how molecular programs emerge in specific
      brain cell types during development, mature through adulthood, and become destabilized with aging.
    </p>

    <h3>Mechanistic insights into neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease</h3>
    <p>
      Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are highly heritable, yet their clinical manifestations often
      appear long after genetic risk is inherited. A central question motivating my work is why this delay exists.
      By studying cell-type–specific regulatory programs in the human brain, I aim to identify which molecular
      mechanisms and cell populations become vulnerable during key developmental windows or later in aging, and
      how these changes contribute to disease onset and progression.
    </p>

    <h3>Regulatory organization of the healthy genome across the lifespan</h3>
    <p>
      In parallel, I study the regulatory architecture of the healthy human genome across development, adulthood,
      and aging. By mapping chromatin accessibility, gene regulation, and three-dimensional genome organization in
      specific brain cell types, my work seeks to define how molecular programs normally emerge, stabilize, and
      decline over time. This provides a critical reference for distinguishing disease-related changes from normal
      developmental and aging processes.
    </p>

    <h3>Role of repeat elements in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases</h3>
    <p>
      Tandem repeats (TRs)—short DNA motifs repeated consecutively—are highly polymorphic elements that comprise
      approximately 6% of the human genome, far exceeding the ~2% devoted to protein-coding sequences. Variation
      in TR length is known to influence gene expression, RNA splicing, and chromatin structure, positioning these
      elements as powerful regulators of genome function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite their abundance and functional impact, tandem repeats and other repetitive elements have been largely
      overlooked in large-scale genetic studies, which have focused predominantly on single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms. As a result, the contribution of these highly mutable genomic elements to psychiatric and
      neurodegenerative disease risk—and to missing heritability more broadly—remains poorly understood. My work
      aims to address this gap by integrating repeat variation with cell-type–specific regulatory and epigenomic
      maps of the human brain.
